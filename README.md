# 🧠 Focus Pulse

A **privacy-first Chrome Extension** that helps users understand and improve their browsing habits by tracking website usage, measuring focus, and providing insightful analytics—all while keeping data stored **locally on the user's device**.

---

## 📌 Overview

Focus Pulse is designed to help users become more aware of their browsing behavior without compromising their privacy.

Unlike cloud-based productivity tools, this extension stores all browsing statistics locally using the Chrome Storage API. No personal browsing data is sent to external servers.

The extension monitors website usage, calculates a daily focus score, provides productivity insights, and displays trends through an interactive dashboard.

# 🚀 How It Works

The extension continuously monitors the currently active browser tab while the browser window is focused.

It records:

- Time spent on each website
- Tab switches
- Browsing sessions
- Daily statistics

Using this information, the extension calculates a Focus Score and generates productivity insights displayed in both the popup and the analytics dashboard.

---

# 📊 Focus Score

The Focus Score is calculated using browsing behavior, including:

- Time spent browsing
- Number of tab switches
- Number of short browsing sessions
- Browsing consistency

The score is translated into a productivity grade ranging from **A** to **D**.

---

# 🔐 Privacy

Focus Pulse follows a **local-first architecture**.

- No external servers
- No cloud storage
- No account required
- No analytics
- No tracking outside the browser
- User data never leaves the device unless explicitly exported

---

# 🌱 Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements include:

- Dark mode
- Custom productivity goals
- Monthly reports
- Focus session reminders
- Website categorization
- Chrome Web Store publication
- Weight the focus score by time-of-day and session length. The
  current formula (flat -1.5 per switch, -3 per short visit, -10
  if more than 15 sites) is a straightforward v1 heuristic and
  doesn't yet account for when a session happened or how long it
  ran.
